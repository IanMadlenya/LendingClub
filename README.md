Lending Club Data Analysis and Algorithms

lcbt.py is a Genetic Algorithm which analyses the Lending Club data and searches for the best criteria and lending club filters to reduce default rates and maximize (NAR) Net Annual Return

The inspiration comes from David M. Patierno PHP implementation

Lending Club Data can be found here and is automatically downloaded if it cannot be found [https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action)

Lending Club Data field descriptions are here [http://www.lendingclub.com/kb/index.php?View=entry&EntryID=253](http://www.lendingclub.com/kb/index.php?View=entry&EntryID=253)

Here are the usage models

```
C:\pypy-2.0.2\pypy.exe lcbt.py

C:\Python27\python.exe -O lcbt.py

C:\Python32\python.exe -O lcbt.py
```
Best performance with linux + pypy + zmqpy

### Pypy2.0 beta version on linux with 8-threads
[iteration 190/4096 6.16 sec/iter] 1024 loans (48/mo.) test at 15.63% APY. 45 loans defaulted (4.00%, $21.30 avg loss) 11.9808% net APY

### Python27 version on linux with 8-threads
[iteration 53/4096 49.54 sec/iter] 1013 loans (50/mo.) test at 15.51% APY. 40 loans defaulted (3.00%, $21.15 avg loss) 12.2170% net APY
